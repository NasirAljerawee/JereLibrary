The LM (Liquidity-Money) curve, from Keynesian economics, illustrates the relationship between liquidity preference (demand for money) and interest rates.

*Vertical LM Curve*

A vertical LM curve occurs when:

1. *Perfect liquidity trap*: At very low interest rates, people hoard cash, expecting interest rates to rise or inflation to increase, making bonds less attractive.
2. *Money demand becomes infinitely elastic*: People are unwilling to lend or invest, preferring cash holdings regardless of interest rate changes.

Characteristics:

- Interest rates have minimal impact on money demand.
- Monetary policy effectiveness is reduced.
- Economy is highly sensitive to fiscal policy.

*Horizontal LM Curve*

A horizontal LM curve occurs when:

1. *Perfect money substitute*: Other assets (e.g., bonds) become perfect substitutes for money, making demand for money insensitive to interest rate changes.
2. *Money demand is perfectly inelastic*: Changes in interest rates do not affect money demand.

Characteristics:

- Interest rates significantly influence investment and consumption.
- Monetary policy is highly effective.
- Fiscal policy has minimal impact.

Key points:

- The LM curve's slope reflects the responsiveness of money demand to interest rate changes.
- Vertical and horizontal LM curves represent extreme scenarios, rarely observed in reality.
- The actual LM curve typically slopes upward, indicating a positive relationship between interest rates and money demand.
